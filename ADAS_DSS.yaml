  description: "This model assesses Cutworm risk in crops based on the work of Bowden\
    \ et al., (1982). The model was originally devised to estimate an index of larval\
    \ survival to third instar, based on temperature rate of development relationships\
    \ and mortality due to daily rainfall.\nThe default model start date is defined\
    \ as the first day after 1st June where temperature exceeds 12 degrees. The model\
    \ will end on the 31st October.\nAny spray dates can be inputted into the model\
    \ and are deemed to be 100% effective at removing cutworm from the model.\nThe\
    \ model will return the number of batches that survive to the third instar, the\
    \ associated risk and the recommended action.\n\nSOURCE: \nASSUMPTIONS: \nREFERENCE: "

        This decision tool predicts the timing of flights of Cydia pomella (colding moth) to help time insecticide treatment.    
        Typically it is more effective to treat early in the flight, rather than waiting for the peak of the flight (maximum risk).   
        The timing of treatment might need to be adjusted depending on the type of insecticide used. 
        In southern Europe there can be three flights in a season.     
        The prediction is about timing and does not predict the number of codling moths.
        Green warning indicates that cumulative catches are below 10% or above 65% in all the flights.
      recommended_action: The risk is low, and no action is required but it is recommended
        to revisit regularly as risk can change rapidly.
