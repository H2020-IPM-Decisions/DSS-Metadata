    purpose: Estimates the risk of cutworm larvae surviving to third instar
    description: >-
      THE PEST: Cutworm are caterpillars of a few species of moth (e.g. Agrotis
      species) that feed at the base and roots of various crops. Eggs are laid
      in late spring, and the first three instar feed on surface vegetation,
      before burrowing into roots. Once they've moved into the roots, they
      cannot be controlled using contact treatments (e.g. insecticides). As
      adults continue to lay eggs in the crop, several 'batches' of larvae, at
      different instars, can be present in the crop. 


      THE DECISION: The DSS predicts the number of instar 1, 2 or 3 larval
      batches that could be active in the crop. When 4 or more batches are
      predicted, treatment is recommended to prevent high numbers of larvae
      moving into the crop roots.

      THE MODEL: This model predicts the number of batches of vulnerable larvae
      (instar 1-3) currently active, based on first appearance of adult moth and
      subsequent larval development. Significant rainfall events cause high
      levels of mortality in larvae, which is included in the model.

      THE PARAMETERS: The model uses a model start date is defined as the first
      day after 1st June where temperature exceeds 12 degrees as a default to
      predict adult moth arrival. Temperature (to determine growth rates) and
      rainfall (to determine mortality), ending on the 31st October. Any spray
      dates can be inputted into the model and are deemed to be 100% effective
      at removing cutworm from the model, but does not prevent subsequent
      batches.

      REGION: This DSS was adapted from work carried out in the UK, and is
      considered applicable, but not yet validated in, Belgium, Luxembourg,
      Netherlands, France, Germany, Rep. Ireland, and Denmark.

      ASSUMPTION: This DSS assumes first arrival of adult moths to be 1st June;
      users monitoring abundance in field should edit the parameter to the
      correct first observation to improve accuracy.

    purpose: Estimates the risk of emergence of adult Orange Wheat Blossom Midge
    description: >-
      THE PEST: Orange wheat blossom midge larvae feed on developing grains,
      causing grains to become small and shrivelled. They can also damage the
      outer grain layer (pericarp), allowing water to enter. This can make the
      grain vulnerable to fungal infection (e.g. fusarium and septoria) and
      result in premature sprouting. Seed from infected crops is also associated
      with poor germination. Susceptible crops are at the highest risk when
      adult midge emergence coincides with ear emergence, particularly growth
      stages 53–59. Larvae that hatch after flowering do not develop properly
      and cause little damage.  


      THE DECISION: The model predicts the emergence of adults and associated
      migration of females into vulnerable crops, when increased monitoring
      and/or treatment may be appropriate.

      THE MODEL: Daily temperature (degrees Celsius) and rainfall (mm) data is
      used to identify emergence of Orange Wheat Blossom Midge. The model runs
      between the months May and June, but requires weather data from the 1st of
      January. The model runs in three phases: Phase 1: Temperature accumulation
      of 250 degree days above 3 degrees from 1st January.  Phase 2 (Low risk):
      Lasts until mean daily temperature reaches 13 degrees Celsius, followed by
      rainfall (>2mm). During Phase 1 and 2, there is a low risk of emergence. Phase 3
      (Medium risk): One phase 2 is complete, temperature accumulation of 160
      degree days above 7 degrees. During phase 3, there is a medium risk of
      emergence. Upon completion of phase 3 the risk is considered high for
      three days and a date of emergence is predicted, which will be reported in
      the platform. Multiple emergence dates are possible, leading to extended
      periods of high risk of emergence.

      THE PARAMETERS: The model uses daily temperature and rainfall

      REGION: This DSS was adapted from work carried out in Belgium, and is
      considered to be applicable, but yet to be validated in, the UK, 
      Luxembourg, Netherlands, France, Germany, Denmark.

      ASSUMPTIONS: This DSS assumes that the crop variety use is vulnerable to
      damage by orange wheat blossom midge, and that the user will interpret the
      risk against the vulnerability of the crop growth stage on farm.

    purpose: Estimates the risk of pollen beetle migration
    description: >-
      THE PEST: Pollen beetle (Meligethes spp.) adults are approximately 2.5 mm,
      metallic greenish-black. Females bite oilseed rape buds and lay their eggs
      inside. Adults and larvae attack buds and flowers, resulting in withered
      buds and reduced pod set. In oilseed rape, adult and larval feeding can
      lead to bud abortion and reduced pod set. However, damage rarely results
      in reduced yields for winter crops. Spring crops are more vulnerable, as
      the susceptible green/yellow bud stage often coincides with beetle
      migration. 


      THE DECISION: Oilseed rape is only vulnerable if large numbers of pollen
      beetle migrate into the crop during green bud stage. This DSS predicts
      migration into crops based on air temperature, and so can be used to
      evaluate risk to crop.

      THE MODEL: Daily maximum air temperature is used to predict Migration
      Risk. The default value of 15 degrees celsius is used, as that is the
      temperature advised in the UK at which pollen beetles will fly.   

      THE PARAMETERS: The model uses Daily maximum air temperature   

      REGION: This DSS was adapted from work carried out in the UK, and is
      considered applicable, but not yet validated in, Belgium, Luxembourg,
      Netherlands, France, Germany, Rep. Ireland, and Denmark.

      ASSUMPTIONS: Only to be used during Oilseed rape growth stages 51-59. This
      model is a simplification of a more detailed model described in the paper
      below.

    purpose: Estimates the risk of emergence of adult saddle gall midge.
    description: >-
      THE PEST: Saddle gall midge (Haplodiplosis marginata) is a sporadic pest
      of cereals, which usually persists at low population levels. Yield loss
      can be caused by constricted vascular supply to the ears as a result of
      larval feeding and by lodging of gall-weakened stems in high winds. Pupae
      overwinter in the soil, from which adults emerge in the spring to lay eggs
      on vulnerable crops. Damage is caused by subsequent larval feeding. Once
      larvae have crawled under the leaf sheath,  they cannot be controlled
      using contact treatments (e.g. insecticides).


      THE DECISION: This DSS indicates the best time to monitor crops for
      infestations (start of emergence). If abundance is high, and non-chemical
      managment options are unlikely to achieve adequate control, treatment
      needs to be applied before, or soon after oviposition.

      THE MODEL: Cumulative emergence as a function of degree day accumulations
      described using a probit model. The model starts on the date of first
      rainfall on or after the 1st March and ends at the end of July. The model
      returns predicted proportion cumulative emergence, the associated risk and
      recommended action.

      THE PARAMETERS: The model uses accumulative daily temperature (500 degree
      days above 0 degrees C)  

      REGION: This DSS was adapted from work carried out in the UK, and is
      considered applicable, but not yet validated in, Belgium, Luxembourg,
      Netherlands, France, Germany, and Denmark.

      THE PARAMETERS: The model uses Daily temperature and rainfall

      ASSUMPTIONS: This DSS assumes the earliest date of emergence of saddle
      gall midge to be after 500 day degrees. User must interpret the reported
      risk against the vulnerability of the crop growth stage on farm, and
      undertake  in field monitoring to assess the abundance of emerging
      adults.

      Estimates the risk of the start of codling moth flight into crops, and
      associated egg laying in pome fruit.
    description: >-
      THE PEST: Codling moth [Cydia pomonella] cause damage to fruit of apples,
      pears and other pome fruit. Larvae emerge from eggs laid on the surface of
      the fruit, and burrow inside. The surface blemish can reduce the value of
      fruit, internal damage renders the fruit unsellable.


      THE DECISION: The DSS predicts the start of adult codling moth flight,
      enabling users to undertake targeted monitoring and/or mitigating actions
      to reduce the risk of damage to the crop. Typically interventions are more
      effective at the start of male flight, rather than at peak flight
      periods.   

      THE MODEL: A 3-paramater non-linear regression model fits cumulative moth
      captures as a function of accumulated day degrees (Biofix 1st January) for
      all three of the male flights. The model predicts that 1st migration
      begins after 151 day degrees, 2nd migration begins after 673 day degrees,
      and 3rd migration begins after 1303 day degrees. The start of migration
      events are reported in the DSS warnings to the user. 

      REGION: This DSS was adapted from work carried out in Greece, and is
      considered applicable, but not yet validated in,  Albania, Romania,
      Bosnia, Croatia, Italy, Macedonia, Montenegro, Portugal, San Marino,
      Slovenia, Slovakia, and Spain

      THE PARAMETERS: The model uses Minimum and maximum temperature from the
      1st of January.

      SOURCE: Aristotle University, Greece. 

      ASSUMPTIONS: There may be three flight periods in southern Europe, one or
      two in northern Europe. Predict flight does not relate to numbers of
      codling moth, or scale of damage caused.Where flight periods overlap, the
      highest current risk of new migration will be reported.

    purpose: Estimates risk of transmission of virus by aphid vectors
    description: >-
      THE PEST: Aphids can transmit barley/cereal yellow dwarf viruses (BYDV).
      Initially, aphids colonise relatively few crop plants. However, the
      second-generation tends to move away from the plant originally colonised.
      Controlling this generation is a key part of a BYDV management strategy.


      THE DECISION: This DSS indicates the best time to monitor crops for
      aphids. If infestations are high, and non-chemical control options are
      unlikely to prevent second generation emergence, treatment should be
      considered to limit the spread of the virus.

      THE MODEL: The second generation is likely to be present when the
      accumulated daily air temperatures, above a baseline temperature of 3ºC,
      reaches T-Sum 170. 

      THE PARAMETERS: The model uses Date of last spray application, daily
      temperature

      REGION: This DSS was adapted from work carried out in the UK, and is
      considered applicable, but not yet validated in, Belgium, Luxembourg,
      Netherlands, France, Germany, Rep. Ireland, and Denmark.

      ASSUMPTIONS: This DSS assumes that the user will update the date of last
      insecticide applications. Its also assumes that no aphids found or
      insecticide treatment applied at 170DD, and restarts calculations. 2nd
      generation development time is consistent across regions.

    purpose: Estimates potential for septoria epidemics
    description: >
      THE PEST: Septoria tritici blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici) affects the
      leaves of wheat crops and is particularly damaging to yield when it
      reduces the green canopy area of the upper leaves during grain filling.   

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatment to protect the upper leaves may need to
      be applied between stem extension and ear emergence, before symptoms are
      visible on those leaves.  

      THE MODEL: At stem extension (growth stage 31) the model uses over-winter
      weather to estimate the potential for a damaging epidemic developing
      during the summer. This information can support treatment decisions.  It
      should be considered along with other risk factors, particularly: septoria
      resistance of the wheat variety, sowing date, location and weather
      conditions during the emergence of the upper leaves.  

      THE PARAMETERS: the model uses data on minimum temperature and rainfall
      over-winter.

      Pathology.  

      ASSUMPTIONS: The model provides an early estimate of the potential for an
      epidemic and should be interpreted in combination with other risk factors.

    purpose: The purpose of the model is to determine the threshold at which control measures are recommended
    description: >-
      THE PEST: Grey field slug (Deroceras reticulatum) are the most important slug pest in crops with they causing 
      over 95% of most slug damage. Slug damage are commonly seed hollowing before and during seed germination leading to patchy fields, 
      and damage continues on seedlings and young cereal shoots up to GS21. They thrive in humid conditions with large quantities of food. 
      In most cases, they reside in soil up to 10 cm deep and are 3 to 5 cm in length. Due to its limited food reserve, this slug feeds 
      more frequently under a variety of conditions. The slug can feed and reproduce year-round, regardless of whether it is below or above ground.
      Seedbeds with clods and plants that are direct drilled or minimally cultivated are likely to be damaged by slugs. Farming activities such as 
      ploughing also fail to affect them as they move back to the soil surface to cause damage.
      THE DECISION: Slug refuge traps should be placed in standing cereal crops or in stubble over a one-night period from May to October when weather
      conditions such as temperatures between 5 -25 degrees and moist soil surfaces occur. Slugs should be counted before temperatures rise and they leave refuge traps.
      The trapping should continue until the vulnerable stage of the crop has passed.
      THE THRESHOLD: Crops are considered to be at risk of economic damage where an average of four or more slugs are found per refuge trap.
      THE ASSESSMENT: Assessment is most effective where periods of slug activity are correctly identified; e.g. after period of wet or humid weather. 
      REGION: 
      ASSUMPTION: This depends on identifying the periods of slug activity for greater chances of trapping them

      THE PEST: Grey field slug (Deroceras reticulatum) are the most important slug pest in crops with they causing over 95% of most slug damage. 
      The most damage to oilseed rape occurs during the establishment phase (between sowing and the four true leaf stage), with leaf shredding
      more common than seed hollowing. They thrive in humid conditions with large quantities of food. In most cases, they reside in soil up to 
      10 cm deep and are 3 to 5 cm in length. Due to its limited food reserve, this slug feeds more frequently under a variety of conditions.

      such as temperatures between 5 -25 degrees and moist soil surfaces occur. Slugs should be counted before temperatures rise and they leave refuge traps. 
      The trapping should continue until the vulnerable stage of the crop has passed.
      THE THRESHOLD: Crops are considered to be at risk of economic damage where an average of one or more slugs are found per refuge trap.
      THE ASSESSMENT: Set up minimum of nine refuge traps per 20 ha (13 in fields larger than 20 ha) in a “W” pattern. Refuge traps can be made from an
      upturned saucer, baited with chicken layers mash. Threshold assessed based on the overall average number of slugs found per trap 24hrs after setting them.
      REGION: 
      ASSUMPTION: Assessment is most effective where periods of slug activity are correctly identified; e.g. after period of wet or humid weather. 
      Tracking slug abundance over time is recommended, rather than single assessments.

  - name: IPM Tool for crop planning
    id: IPMTOOL
    version: '1.0'
    type_of_decision: Seasonal strategic
    type_of_output: Guidance on IPM control methods     
    description_URL: https://ipmtool.net
    purpose: Provides guidance on IPM control methods for specific pests, diseases and weeds 
    description: >-
      THE PEST: This IPM planning tool provides information on all the major pests, weeds and diseases of
      many arable and outdoor horticultural crops. 
      THE DECISION: The user selects the crop types they grow.  The IPM Tool provides a list of the pests,
      weeds and diseases which affect each type of crop, together with identification guides.  The user selects
      the pests, weeds and diseases which are a problem on their farm. The Tool provides guidance on effective IPM 
      control methods for each of the pests, weeds and diseases selected.  Links are provided to independent sources
      of information about each method. The user can select those methods appropriate for their farming system.  
      An IPM crop plan is then produced, recording the IPM control methods planned.  The plan can be updated during 
      the crop season. 
      SOURCE: The IPM Tool was developed by ADAS and SRUC, in a project led by the NFU and funded by Defra.
      ASSUMPTIONS: The IPM Tool provides links to external sources of independent information from reputable
      sources, but over which the developers of the tool have no control.
