    description: >-
      Sclerotinia stem rot is usually the main disease to consider during the
      flowering stages of oilseed rape. There are 3 main risk factors: the
      presence of sclerotinia inoculum (spores), warm and humid conditions, and
      crops in flower.

      If spores are present and the crop is in flower, relative humidity must be
      above 80% and air temperatures above 7&deg;C for 23 continuous hours for the
      pathogen to infect the crop. This is what is predicted by the model.

      Predicts the date when 10% of oilseed rape plants may show symptoms of
      phoma leaf spot
    description: >-
      Temperature and rainfall information is used to simulate the development
      of Leptosphaeria maculans -- a key pathogen responsible for phoma leaf spot
      and phoma stem canker.

      The forecast predicts the date of the starting week when 10% of oilseed
      rape plants could potentially show symptoms of phoma leaf spot.
