    purpose: The model helps to create healthy crop rotations in relation to nematodes
    description: >-
      THE PEST: Plant parasitic nematodes can cause serious damage to crop yield
      and crop quality. Important groups of plant parasitic nematodes are: cyst
      nematodes, root-knot nematodes, root-lesions nematodes, stem nematodes and
      free living nematodes. THE DECISION: Nematodes can best be managed by
      healthy crop rotations, as crops and crop varieties have a different host
      status for nematodes. Alternating host and non-host crops or varieties
      lowers infestation rates in the soil. THE MODEL: The model databases
      contain information about susceptibility and tolerance of 70 crops to 32
      nematodes. The databases are neither soil-specific nor country-specific.
      PARAMETERS: The returns risks based on crops, including green manure
      crops, and crop rotation. This farm specific input has to be provided by
      the user. SOURCE: Created by H2020 project Best4Soil, based on the Dutch
      model www.aaltjesschema.nl, developed by Wageningen University and
      Research. ASSUMPTIONS: The model gives risk information, assuming that the
      user selected plant parasitic nematodes are present in the field.

    description: '  THE PEST: Soil-borne pathogens can cause serious damage to crop yield and quality. Major groups of such pathogens are: Fusarium, Phoma, Phomopsis, Phytophthora, Pythium, Rhizoctonia and Sclerotinia. Soil-borne pathogens can often be managed by crop rotations, as they infect only certain crop species and usually decline in the absence of a host crop.  A rotation containing non-host crops or varieties can lower infestation rates in the soil. THE MODEL: The model databases contain information about susceptibility and tolerance of 70 crops to 135 pathogens. PARAMETERS: The model uses crops, including green manure crops, and crop rotation. This farm specific input has to be provided by the user. SOURCE: Created by H2020 project Best4Soil, analogue to the Dutch model www.aaltjesschema.nl, developed by Wageningen University and Research. ASSUMPTIONS: The model gives risk information, assuming that the user selected plant pathogens are present in the field. At the moment, the databases are neither soil-specific, nor country-specific. This means that the crop schemes are identical for different soil types and countries. At this moment there is insufficient country-specific information on host status and sensitivity to crop damage per crop to make the database country-specific. The same is the case for soil type specific information. Because soil type plays a role in the occurrence of  soil pathogens, the soil type selection button has been built in to enable soil type specific schemes in the future. '
