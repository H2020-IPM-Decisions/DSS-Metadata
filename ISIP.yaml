      THE PEST: Brown rust affects both wheat and barley crops. It is also known as leaf rust.  There is large seasonal and geographic variation in brown rust severity. Cold winters may reduce its spread.

      THE DECISION: In wheat, apply a fungicide with activity against brown rust when the disease is seen and conditions are conducive or at T2 and T3 in high-risk situations
      In barley, use fungicides early to control the disease. However, the azole/SDHI mixes used on other barley diseases will usually provide sufficient control

      THE MODEL: With this weather-based simulation model, you can calculate the infection probability of powdery mildew in cereals  to define periods of high risk.

      THE PARAMETERS  The probability of infection should be understood as an interpretation of weather conditions (temperature and leaf wetness duration) and their influence on the development of an infection.

    description: >-
      THE PEST: Powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis)can infect all cereals. However, its visual appearance usually outweighs the damage potential, especially during the autumn and winter. In highly-susceptible varieties, yield losses can be up to 20% and early control can be very important. However, the disease generally causes much smaller yield losses (rarely exceeding 10%) and late attacks (after flowering) on the flag-leaf and ear rarely cause significant losses. Crops under stress, late-sown crops, and crops that are growing rapidly in the spring are often particularly prone to attack. Early attacks can reduce tiller number and excessive nitrogen fertiliser can encourage the disease. Mildew can be particularly severe in dense crops.

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between late tillering (GS 29) and before heading (GS 40), to protect leaves from attack of powdery mildew and yield losses.

      THE MODEL: With this weather-based simulation model, you can calculate the infection probability of powdery mildew in cereals  to define periods of high risk.

      THE PARAMETERS  The probability of infection should be understood as an interpretation of weather conditions (temperature and leaf wetness duration) and their influence on the development of an infection.

      THE PEST: Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Drechslera tritici-repentis) is the pathogen that causes tan spot. It affects wheat but can also attack barley, rye and some grasses. Tan spot is very common in Sweden, Denmark, Germany and France. However, in the UK, it is only occasionally recorded in disease surveys and rarely causes serious yield or quality (specific weight) losses.

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between beginning of elongation (GS 31) and beginning of grain filling (GS 71), to protect leaves from attack of tan spot and yield losses.

      THE MODEL: With this weather-based simulation model, you can calculate the infection probability of powdery mildew in cereals  to define periods of high risk.

      THE PARAMETERS  The probability of infection should be understood as an interpretation of weather conditions (temperature and leaf wetness duration) and their influence on the development of an infection.

      THE PEST: Leaf blotch diseases of wheat can be caused by septoria tritici blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici) and staganospora nodorum blotch (Parastagonospora nodorum), which are both favoured by wet conditions. Septoria often results in elongated, oval septoria lesions that are restricted by leaf veins, giving a rectangular appearance. Water-soaked patches often form, surrounded by leaf yellowing or death. Lesions may coalesce to form large areas of necrotic brown tissue. Mature lesions contain characteristic, small (but visible) black fruiting bodies (pycnidia). However, pycnidia are not always visible in immature lesions.

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between stem extension and ear emergence, mainly to protect the upper leaves.

      THE MODEL: With this weather-based simulation model, you can calculate the infection probability of powdery mildew in cereals  to define periods of high risk.

      THE PARAMETERS  The probability of infection should be understood as an interpretation of weather conditions (temperature and leaf wetness duration) and their influence on the development of an infection.

      THE PEST: Yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis) is known to attack wheat and rye. The characteristic symptom of yellow rust is of parallel rows of yellowish orange coloured pustules on the leaves of adult plants. Epidemics of yellow rust often start as individual plants, usually in the autumn. Symptoms develop slowly over winter and are often missed until the early spring when small patches or foci of infected plants can be seen in fields.

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between end of tillering (GS 29) and beginning of grain filling (GS 71) to protect leaves from attack of yellow rust and yield losses.

      THE MODEL: With this weather-based simulation model, you can calculate the infection probability of powdery mildew in cereals  to define periods of high risk.

      THE PARAMETERS  The probability of infection should be understood as an interpretation of weather conditions (temperature and leaf wetness duration) and their influence on the development of an infection.

      To calculate the daily infection risk of ramularia leaf spot in barley.
    description: >-
      THE PEST Ramularia leaf spot can result in extensive damage to the upper leaves in barley, leading to losses in grain yield and quality. Initially, the fungus grows symptomless and systemically within new plant growth. Diagnosis during these stages requires molecular approaches. Symptoms usually appear on the upper leaves after flowering, but can show earlier in stressed crops or on senescing leaves.

      THE DECISION The most effective timing for fungicide applications against ramularia is a preventative spray during booting (growth stages 45–49). Later applications, up to ear fully emerged (growth stage 59), may also be effective but may be restricted for malting barley crops. Once symptoms develop on the upper leaves post-flowering, treatment is not effective.

      THE MODEL: With this weather-based simulation model, you can calculate the infection probability of powdery mildew in cereals  to define periods of high risk.

      THE PARAMETERS  The probability of infection should be understood as an interpretation of weather conditions (temperature and leaf wetness duration) and their influence on the development of an infection.

    description: >-
      THE PEST: Net blotch (Pyrenophora teres) is known to attack barley. Infection from splash-borne spores, from infected trash or neighbouring plants, is the most common cause of infection. Symptoms start as individual spots that can easily be mistaken for ramularia leaf spot. These elongate and turn into brown stripes or blotches with a random netting of darker lines along and across the leaf. Symptoms can be extensive in winter but affected leaves die back and new leaves in spring can be symptom-free.

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between start of elongation (GS 30) and full flowering (GS 65), to protect leaves from attack of net blotch and yield losses.

      THE MODEL: With this weather-based simulation model, you can calculate the infection probability of powdery mildew in cereals  to define periods of high risk.

      THE PARAMETERS  The probability of infection should be understood as an interpretation of weather conditions (temperature and leaf wetness duration) and their influence on the development of an infection.

    description: >-
      THE PEST: Leaf blotch, also known as leaf scald or rhynchosporium, affects barley, rye, triticale and a number of grasses, particularly ryegrasses. Symptoms often first appear at the base of the leaf close to the stem, then spread to the rest of the leaf, leaf sheaths, ears and grain, particularly in wet conditions.

      THE DECISION: Most current (2025) fungicides have good protectant activity. However, few treatments have good eradicant activity in high-pressure situations. An effective azole, in mixture with a strobilurin or SDHI fungicide, is a good foundation for disease management.

      THE MODEL: With this weather-based simulation model, you can calculate the infection probability of powdery mildew in cereals  to define periods of high risk.

      THE PARAMETERS  The probability of infection should be understood as an interpretation of weather conditions (temperature and leaf wetness duration) and their influence on the development of an infection.

    description_URL: https://zepp.info/component/content/article?id=176
    purpose: >-
      To calculate the daily infection risk of browen rust in barley.
    description: >-
      THE PEST: Brown rust affects both wheat and barley crops. It is also known as leaf rust.  There is large seasonal and geographic variation in brown rust severity. Cold winters may reduce its spread.

      THE DECISION: In barley, use fungicides early to control the disease. However, the azole/SDHI mixes used on other barley diseases will usually provide sufficient control

      THE MODEL: With this weather-based simulation model, you can calculate the infection probability of powdery mildew in cereals  to define periods of high risk.

      THE PARAMETERS  The probability of infection should be understood as an interpretation of weather conditions (temperature and leaf wetness duration) and their influence on the development of an infection.

      ASSUMPTIONS: Since no agronomic factors such as sowing date or variety susceptibility are taken into account  it serves as an indicator for field inspections
