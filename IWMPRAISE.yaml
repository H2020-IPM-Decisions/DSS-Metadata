    purpose: >-
      An online strategic tool for identifying suitable management practices for
      annual and perennial weeds in narrow row, broad row and perennial crops.
    description: >-
      THE PEST: Perennial and annual weed infestations can lead to direct and
      indirect damage to a wide range of outdoor crops. 

      THE DECISION: Integrated weed management tactics may affect one or more
      axes in the weed life cycle. They may prevent the establishment of
      seedlings from the seedbank (axis 1), reduce the impact established weeds
      have on the crop (axis 2), or reduce the weed seed/bud return to the soil
      (axis 3).

      THE IWMPRAISE TOOL: This tool supports users in identifying and
      understanding the IPM tools and tactics available to manage perennial and
      annual weeds in narrow row, broad row and perennial crops. Users can
      select/de-select options to identify the best approach for them. This tool
      is currently available in English only. 

      SOURCE: The IWMPRAISE TOOL was developed as part of the EU funded Horizon
      2020 IWMPRAISE (727321), 2017-2022. It is designed for use across
      Europe.
