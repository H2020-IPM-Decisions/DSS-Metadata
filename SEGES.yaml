      THE PEST: Leaf blotch diseases of wheat can be caused by septoria tritici
      blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici) and staganospora nodorum blotch
      (Parastagonospora nodorum), which are both  favoured by wet conditions. 

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between stem
      extension and ear emergence, mainly to protect the upper leaves.  

      THE MODEL: Weather data from GS 31 are used. The humidity model estimates
      risk of septoria tritici blotch infections in winter wheat. Risk of attack
      is assumed after 20 hours with continuous wetness. A wet hour is defined
      as minimum 0,2 mm precipitation in an hour or minimum 85% relative
      humidity. 

      THE PARAMETERS:  Dates of key growth stages are given as default values,
      but these may not be correct for your location.  To obtain accurate risk
      predictions it is essential to click on the 'Edit parameters' button,
      enter the estimated dates of GS31 (first node detectable), GS32 (second
      node; third upper leaf emerging), GS33 (third node; second upper leaf
      emerging), GS37/39 (uppermost flag leaf emerging)  and GS75 (grain content
      milky), then click on the 'Save' button.  These estimated dates can be
      updated during the season as growth stages are reached. Adding information
      on septoria fungicide spray dates is vital for the model. This is also
      done in 'Edit parameters'.  Clicking on 'Save' will keep the spray dates
      entered.  After spraying, the model assumes that the crop is protected for
      10 days.

      ASSUMPTIONS: septoria tritici blotch is present in the crop and periods
      with high humidity create risk for a damaging epidemic

      THE PEST: powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) is known to attack barley. 

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between early
      tillering (GS 26)  and full flowering (GS 65), to protect leaves from
      attack of powdery mildew and yield losses. 

      THE MODEL: The CPO powdery mildew model is recommending treatments in
      barley when thresholds are exceeded.  The risk of attack is based on
      visual monitoring using frequency of plants attacked.   In susceptible
      cultivars treatments are recommended at lower incidence levels than in
      resistant cultivars.  If a green color appears then no action is needed,
      yellow means that a limited risk is recognized, while red indicates that
      action is recommended.  If treatments are recommended specific fungicides
      known to be effective against this disease should be chosen.  When running
      the powdery mildew model the risk for yield losses from other diseases is
      not considered. If no action is recommended it is advised to revisit the
      crop after ca. one week to make a new evaluation of the risk. 
        
      THE PARAMETERS  To obtain accurate risk  predictions it is essential to
      click on the 'Edit parameters' button, Enter information on the cultivar’s
      susceptibility to powdery mildew. Only two categorizes are used
      susceptible and resistant, if a cultivar is categorized as partly
      resistant,  it is recommended to considered it as susceptible.  Enter the
      specific growth stages at the time when the crop monitoring was done. 
      Enter information on the incidence of attacked plants by powdery mildew
      based on scouting the crop. Between GS  29-31 whole crop should be
      assessed. Between GS 32 and 40 assessments should only be done on 3 upper
      leaves.  Enter information on last fungicide spray dates is vital for the
      model. This is also  done in 'Edit parameters'.  Clicking on 'Save' will
      keep the spray dates  entered.  After spraying, the model assumes that the
      crop is protected for  14 days if a broad spectrum fungicide has been
      applied.

      countries previously, but this might not have included testing of the
      specific brown rust part.

    purpose: Predicts the need for treatment against barley net blotch
    description: >-
      THE PEST: net blotch (Pyrenophora teres) is known to attack barley. 

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between start of
      elongation  (GS 30)  and full flowering (GS 65), to protect leaves from
      attack of net blotch and yield losses. 

      THE MODEL: The CPO net blotch model is recommending treatments in barley
      when thresholds are exceeded.  The risk of attack is based on visual
      monitoring using frequency of plants attacked.   In susceptible cultivars
      treatments are recommended at lower incidence levels than in resistant
      cultivars.  If a green color appears then no action is needed, yellow
      means that a limited risk is recognized, while red indicates that action
      is recommended.  If treatments are recommended specific fungicides known
      to be effective against net blotch  should be chosen.  When running the
      net blotch model, the risk for yield losses from other diseases is not
      considered.   If no action is recommended it is advised to revisit the
      crop after ca. one week to make a new evaluation of the risk. 

      THE PARAMETERS  To obtain accurate risk  predictions it is essential to
      click on the 'Edit parameters' button, Enter information on the cultivar’s
      susceptibility to net blotch. Only two categorizes are used susceptible
      and resistant, if a cultivar is categorized as partly resistant, it is
      recommended to consider it as susceptible.  Enter the specific growth
      stages at the time when the crop monitoring was done.  Enter information
      on the incidence of attacked plants by net blotch based on scouting the
      crop. Between GS  30-31 whole plants should be assessed. Between GS 32 and
      65 assessments should be based only on 3 upper leaves.  Enter information
      on last fungicide spray dates is vital for the model. This is also  done
      in 'Edit parameters'.  Clicking on 'Save' will keep the spray dates 
      entered.  After spraying, the model assumes that the crop is protected for
      14 days if a broad spectrum fungicide has been applied.

      THE PEST: powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) is known to attack wheat  

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between late
      tillering (GS 29)  and before heading (GS 40), to protect leaves from
      attack of powdery mildew and yield losses. 

      THE MODEL: The CPO powdery mildew model is recommending treatments in
      wheat when thresholds are exceeded.  The risk of attack is based on visual
      monitoring using frequency of plants attacked.   In susceptible cultivars
      treatments are recommended at lower incidence levels than in resistant
      cultivars.  If a green color appears then no action is needed, yellow
      means that a limited risk is recognized, while red indicates that action
      is recommended.  If treatments are recommended specific fungicides known
      to be effective against this disease should be chosen.  When running the
      powdery mildew model the risk for yield losses from other diseases is not
      considered.   If no action is recommended it is advised to revisit the
      crop after ca. one week to make a new evaluation of the risk. 

      THE PARAMETERS  To obtain accurate risk  predictions it is essential to
      click on the 'Edit parameters' button, Enter information on the cultivar’s
      susceptibility to powdery mildew.  Only two categorizes are used
      susceptible and resistant, if a cultivar is categorized as partly
      resistant, we recommend that it is considered as susceptible.  Enter the
      specific growth stages at the time when the crop monitoring was done. 
      Enter information on the incidence of attacked plants by powdery mildew
      based on scouting the crop.  Between GS  29-31 infection on whole plants
      should be assessed. Between GS 32 and 40 assessments should only be done
      on 3 upper leaves.  Enter information on last fungicide spray dates is
      vital for the model. This is also  done in 'Edit parameters'.   Clicking
      on 'Save' will keep the spray dates  entered.  After spraying, the model
      assumes that the crop is protected for  14 days if a broad spectrum
      fungicide has been applied.

      SOURCE: Created by Aarhus University and SEGES and released in Denmark in
      2000. The whole CPO model has been tested in the Nordic and Baltic
      countries previously, but this might not have included testing of the
      specific powdery mildew part.

    purpose: Predicts the need for treatment against Septoria in wheat
    description: >-

      THE PEST: Leaf blotch diseases of wheat can be caused by septoria tritici
      blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici), and Septoria nodorum blotch (Stagonospora
      nodorium),  which are both favoured by wet conditions.  THE DECISION:
      Fungicide treatments may need to be applied once or twice between stem
      extension (GS 32) and flowering (GS 69),  mainly to protect the upper
      leaves from attack of Septoria diseases.  THE MODEL: The CPO Septoria
      model estimates risk of septoria tritici blotch infections in winter
      wheat. Weather data from GS 32 to GS 69 are used.  Spraying is recommended
      after min. 4 days with rain (> 1mm) in susceptible cultivars counting days
      between GS 32 and GS 69.  In resistant cultivars risk of attack is assumed
      after 5 days with rain (>1mm) between GS 37 and GS 69. Counting of days
      with rain goes back max 30 days.  When running the Septoria model the risk
      for yield losses from other diseases than Septoria is not considered.   If
      a green color appears then no action is needed, yellow means that a
      limited risk is recognized, while red indicates that action is
      recommended.  If no action is recommended it is advised to revisit the
      crop after ca. one week to make a new evaluation of the risk. 

      THE PARAMETERS  To obtain accurate risk  predictions it is essential to
      click on the 'Edit parameters' button, Enter information on the cultivar’s
      susceptibility to Septoria diseases. Only two categorizes are used
      susceptible and resistant, if a cultivar is categorized as partly
      resistant,  we recommend that it is considered as susceptible.  Enter the
      specific growth stages at the time when the crop monitoring and weather
      data is entered.  Enter information on the incidence of attacked plants by
      Septoria diseases based on scouting the crop on leaf 3 from the top. If
      more than 10% of 3rd leaves (F-2) are attacked  and no previous treatments
      have been applied against Septoria it is recommended to spray regardless
      of fewer than 4 days with precipitation has been counted.  Enter
      information on last fungicide spray dates is vital for the model. This is
      also  done in 'Edit parameters'.  Clicking on 'Save' will keep the spray
      dates  entered.  After spraying, the model assumes that the crop is
      protected for  14 days if a broad spectrum fungicide has been applied.

      THE PEST: Aphids (Sitobian avenae, Rhopalosiphum padi) in wheat   THE
      DECISION: Insecticides may need to be applied from just before heading (GS
      41)  to grain filling  (GS 73), to protect from yield losses caused by
      aphids.  THE MODEL: The CPO aphid model is recommending treatments in
      wheat when thresholds are exceeded.  The risk of attack is based on visual
      monitoring using frequency of infected main straw.  If a green color
      appears then no action is needed, yellow means that a limited risk is
      recognized, while red indicates that action is recommended.  If treatments
      are recommended an insecticide known to be effective against aphids should
      be chosen. When running the aphid model,  the risk for yield losses from
      other pest and diseases is not considered.   If no action is recommended
      it is advised to revisit the crop after ca. one week to make a new
      evaluation of the risk.  THE PARAMETERS  To obtain accurate risk
      predictions it is essential to click on the 'Edit parameters' button,
      Enter the specific growth stages at the time when the crop monitoring was
      done.  Enter information on the incidence of aphid attacked main straw
      based on scouting the crop.
