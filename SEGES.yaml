    THE PEST: Leaf blotch diseases of wheat can be caused by septoria tritici blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici) and staganospora nodorum blotch (Parastagonospora nodorum), which are both  favoured by wet conditions. 
    THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between stem extension and ear emergence, mainly to protect the upper leaves.  
    THE MODEL: The humidity model estimates risk of septoria tritici blotch infections in winter wheat. Risk of attack is assumed after 20 hours with continuous wetness. A wet hour is defined as minimum 0,2 mm precipitation in an hour or minimum 85% relative humidity. 
    THE PARAMETERS: Weather data from GS 31 are used. In addition, the dates of occurrence of growth stages 31 and 32 are entered. The model calculates the expected date for the other stages. This can be adjusted manually. Adding information on fungicide spraying dates is vital for the model. After spraying, the model assumes that the crop is protected for 10 days. The thresholds for number of wet hours and relative humidity can be adjusted manually.  
    SOURCE: Created by Aahus University and SEGES and released in Denmark in 2017. Tested in Lithuania, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark in 2018 and 2019. 
    ASSUMPTIONS: septoria tritici blotch is present and periods with high humidity create risk for a damaging epidemic

    \ GS 65-71\n(assessments of frequency of plants attacked) and for some diseases\
    \ also precipitation is required\n(days with more than 1 mm rain). Before getting\
