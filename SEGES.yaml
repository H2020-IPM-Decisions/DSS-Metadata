      THE PEST: Leaf blotch diseases of wheat can be caused by septoria tritici
      blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici) and staganospora nodorum blotch
      (Parastagonospora nodorum), which are both  favoured by wet conditions. 

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between stem
      extension and ear emergence, mainly to protect the upper leaves.  

      THE MODEL: Weather data from GS 31 are used. The humidity model estimates
      risk of septoria tritici blotch infections in winter wheat. Risk of attack
      is assumed after 20 hours with continuous wetness. A wet hour is defined
      as minimum 0,2 mm precipitation in an hour or minimum 85% relative
      humidity. 

      THE PARAMETERS:  Dates of key growth stages are given as default values,
      but these may not be correct for your location.  To obtain accurate risk
      predictions it is essential to click on the 'Edit parameters' button,
      enter the estimated dates of GS31 (first node detectable), GS32 (second
      node; third upper leaf emerging), GS33 (third node; second upper leaf
      emerging), GS37/39 (uppermost flag leaf emerging)  and GS75 (grain content
      milky), then click on the 'Save' button.  These estimated dates can be
      updated during the season as growth stages are reached. Adding information
      on septoria fungicide spray dates is vital for the model. This is also
      done in 'Edit parameters'.  Clicking on 'Save' will keep the spray dates
      entered.  After spraying, the model assumes that the crop is protected for
      10 days.

      ASSUMPTIONS: septoria tritici blotch is present in the crop and periods
      with high humidity create risk for a damaging epidemic

    purpose: Predicts the need for treatment against mildew in barley
    description: >-
      THE PEST: powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) can attack barley. 

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between early
      tillering (GS 26)  and full flowering (GS 65), to protect leaves from
      powdery mildew and yield losses. 

      THE MODEL: The CPO powdery mildew model is recommending treatments in
      barley when thresholds are exceeded.  The risk of attack is based on
      visual monitoring using frequency of plants attacked.  The disease
      observation is the percentage of plants showing any infection.  For
      example, if 25 plants out of 100 show even a very small amount of disease
      and the remaining 80 plants are completely healthy, then the observation
      is 25%. In susceptible cultivars treatments are recommended at lower
      incidence levels than in resistant cultivars.  If a green color appears
      then no action is needed, yellow means that a limited risk is recognized,
      while red indicates that action is recommended.  If treatments are
      recommended, specific fungicides known to be effective against this
      disease should be chosen.  When running the powdery mildew model, the risk
      for yield losses from other diseases is not considered. If no action is
      recommended it is advised to revisit the crop after about one week to make
      a new evaluation of the risk. 
        
      THE PARAMETERS  To obtain accurate risk  predictions it is essential to
      click on the 'Edit parameters' button to enter information on the
      cultivar's susceptibility to powdery mildew. Only two categorizes are used
      susceptible and resistant, if a cultivar is categorized as partly
      resistant,  it is recommended to considered it as susceptible.  Enter the
      specific growth stages at the time when the crop monitoring was done. 
      Enter information on the incidence of attacked plants by powdery mildew
      based on scouting the crop. Between GS  29-31 whole crop should be
      assessed. Between GS 32 and 40 assessments should only be done on 3 upper
      leaves.  Entering information on last fungicide spray dates is vital for
      the model. This is also done in 'Edit parameters'.  Clicking on 'Save'
      will keep the information entered and the model will immediately update
      the risk estimate.  After spraying, the model assumes that the crop is
      protected for  14 days if a broad spectrum fungicide has been applied.

      2000. The whole CPO model has been tested in the Nordic and Baltic
      countries previously, but this might not have included testing of the
      specific mildew rust part.  This model may be of use in other countries in
      Northern Europe.

      showing any infection.  For example, if 25 plants out of 100 show even a
      very small amount of disease and the remaining 80 plants are completely
      healthy, then the observation is 25%. Between GS  30-31 whole crop should
      be assessed. Between GS 32 and 65 assessments should be based only on 3
      upper leaves.  Entering information on last fungicide spray dates is vital
      for the model. This is also done in 'Edit parameters'.   Clicking on
      'Save' will keep the observations entered and the model will immediately
      update the risk.  After spraying, the model assumes that the crop is
      protected for 14 days if a broad spectrum fungicide has been applied.

      countries previously, but this might not have included testing of the
      specific brown rust part.  This model may be of use in other countries in
      Northern Europe.

    purpose: Predicts the need for treatment against barley net blotch
    description: >-
      THE PEST: net blotch (Pyrenophora teres) is known to attack barley. 

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between start of
      elongation  (GS 30)  and full flowering (GS 65), to protect leaves from
      attack of net blotch and yield losses. 

      THE MODEL: The CPO net blotch model is recommending treatments in barley
      when thresholds are exceeded.  The risk of attack is based on visual
      monitoring using frequency of plants attacked.  The disease observation is
      the percentage of plants showing any infection.  For example, if 25 plants
      out of 100 show even a very small amount of disease and the remaining 80
      plants are completely healthy, then the observation is 25%. In susceptible
      cultivars treatments are recommended at lower incidence levels than in
      resistant cultivars.  If a green color appears then no action is needed,
      yellow means that a limited risk is recognized, while red indicates that
      action is recommended.  If treatments are recommended specific fungicides
      known to be effective against net blotch  should be chosen.  When running
      the net blotch model, the risk for yield losses from other diseases is not
      considered.   If no action is recommended it is advised to revisit the
      crop after approximately one week to make a new evaluation of the risk. 

      THE PARAMETERS  To obtain accurate risk  predictions it is essential to
      click on the 'Edit parameters' button and enter information on the
      cultivar's susceptibility to net blotch. Only two categorizes are used
      susceptible and resistant, if a cultivar is categorized as partly
      resistant, it is recommended to consider it as susceptible.  Enter the
      specific growth stages at the time when the crop monitoring was done. 
      Enter information on the incidence of attacked plants by net blotch based
      on scouting the crop. Between GS  30-31 whole plants should be assessed.
      Between GS 32 and 65 assessments should be based only on 3 upper leaves. 
      Entering information on last fungicide spray dates is vital for the model.
      This is also done in 'Edit parameters'.  Clicking on 'Save' will keep the
      observations entered and the model will update the risk.  After spraying,
      the model assumes that the crop is protected for 14 days if a broad
      spectrum fungicide has been applied.

    purpose: Predicts the need for treatment against mildew in wheat
    description: >-
      THE PEST: powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) is known to attack wheat  

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between late
      tillering (GS 29)  and before heading (GS 40), to protect leaves from
      attack of powdery mildew and yield losses. 

      THE MODEL: The CPO powdery mildew model is recommending treatments in
      wheat when thresholds are exceeded.  The risk of attack is based on visual
      monitoring using frequency of plants attacked.  The disease observation is
      the percentage of plants showing any infection.  For example, if 25 plants
      out of 100 show even a very small amount of disease and the remaining 80
      plants are completely healthy, then the observation is 25%. In susceptible
      cultivars treatments are recommended at lower incidence levels than in
      resistant cultivars.  If a green color appears then no action is needed,
      yellow means that a limited risk is recognized, while red indicates that
      action is recommended.  If treatments are recommended specific fungicides
      known to be effective against this disease should be chosen.  When running
      the powdery mildew model the risk for yield losses from other diseases is
      not considered.   If no action is recommended it is advised to revisit the
      crop after approximately one week to make a new evaluation of the risk. 

      THE PARAMETERS  To obtain accurate risk  predictions it is essential to
      click on the 'Edit parameters' button and enter information on the
      cultivar's susceptibility to powdery mildew.  Only two categories are used
      susceptible and resistant, if a cultivar is categorised as partly
      resistant, we recommend that it is considered as susceptible.  Enter the
      specific growth stages at the time when the crop monitoring was done. 
      Enter information on the incidence of attacked plants by powdery mildew
      based on scouting the crop.  Between GS  29-31 infection on whole plants
      should be assessed. Between GS 32 and 40 assessments should only be done
      on 3 upper leaves.  Entering information on last fungicide spray dates is
      vital for the model. This is also done in 'Edit parameters'.   Clicking on
      'Save' will keep the observations entered and update the risk.  After
      spraying, the model assumes that the crop is protected for  14 days if a
      broad spectrum fungicide has been applied.

      SOURCE: Created by Aarhus University and SEGES and released in Denmark in
      2000. The whole CPO model has been tested in the Nordic and Baltic
      countries previously, but this might not have included testing of the
      specific powdery mildew part.   The model may be of use in other countries
      in Northern Europe.

      THE PEST: Yellow rust  (Puccinia striiformis) is known to attack wheat 
      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between end of
      tillering (GS 29) and beginning of grain filling (GS 71) to protect leaves
      from attack of yellow rust and yield losses.  THE MODEL: The CPO yellow
      rust model is recommending treatments in wheat when thresholds are
      exceeded.  The risk of attack is based on visual monitoring using
      frequency of plants attacked. The disease observation is the percentage of
      plants showing any infection.  For example, if 25 plants out of 100 show
      even a very small amount of disease and the remaining 80 plants are
      completely healthy, then the observation is 25%.   In susceptible
      cultivars treatments are recommended at lower incidence levels than in
      resistant cultivars.  If a green color appears then no action is needed,
      yellow means that a limited risk is recognized, while red indicates that
      action is recommended.  If treatments are recommended specific fungicides
      known to be effective against wheat yellow rust should be chosen.  When
      running the yellow rust model the risk for yield losses from other
      diseases is not considered.   If no action is recommended it is advised to
      revisit the crop after approximately one week to make a new evaluation of
      the risk. 

      THE PARAMETERS  To obtain accurate risk  predictions it is essential to
      click on the 'Edit parameters' button and enter information on the
      cultivar's susceptibility to yellow rust. Only two categorizes are used
      susceptible and resistant,  if a cultivar is categorized as partly
      resistant, it is recommended to consider it as susceptible.  Enter the
      specific growth stages at the time when the crop monitoring was done. 
      Enter information on the incidence of attacked plants by yellow rust 
      based on scouting the crop.  Between GS  29-31 whole crop should be
      assessed. Between GS 32 and 71 assessments should be based only on 3 upper
      leaves.  Enter information on last fungicide spray dates is vital for the
      model. This is also done in 'Edit parameters'.  Clicking on 'Save' will
      keep the observations  entered and update the risk.  After spraying, the
      model assumes that the crop is protected for 14 days if a broad spectrum
      fungicide has been applied.

      2000. The whole CPO model has been tested in the Nordic and Baltic
      countries previously, but this might not have included testing of the
      specific yellow rust part.   The model may be of use in other countries in
      Northern Europe.

      THE PEST: Leaf blotch diseases of wheat can be caused by septoria tritici
      blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici), and Septoria nodorum blotch (Stagonospora
      nodorium),  which are both favoured by wet conditions.  THE DECISION:
      Fungicide treatments may need to be applied once or twice between stem
      extension (GS 32) and flowering (GS 69),  mainly to protect the upper
      leaves from attack of Septoria diseases.  THE MODEL: The CPO Septoria
      model estimates risk of septoria tritici blotch infections in winter
      wheat. Weather data from GS 32 to GS 69 are used.  Spraying is recommended
      after minimum 4 days with rain (> 1mm) in susceptible cultivars counting
      days between GS 32 and GS 69.  In resistant cultivars risk of attack is
      assumed after 5 days with rain (>1mm) between GS 37 and GS 69. Counting of
      days with rain goes back a maximum of 30 days.  When running the Septoria
      model the risk for yield losses from other diseases than Septoria is not
      considered.   If a green color appears then no action is needed, yellow
      means that a limited risk is recognized, while red indicates that action
      is recommended.  If no action is recommended it is advised to revisit the

      THE PARAMETERS  To obtain accurate risk  predictions it is essential to
      click on the 'Edit parameters' button and enter information on the
      cultivar's susceptibility to Septoria diseases. Only two categorizes are
      used susceptible and resistant, if a cultivar is categorized as partly
      resistant,  we recommend that it is considered as susceptible.  Enter the
      specific growth stages at the time when the crop monitoring and weather
      data is entered.  Enter information on the incidence of attacked plants by
      Septoria diseases based on scouting the crop on leaf 3 from the top. If
      more than 10% of 3rd leaves (F-2) are attacked  and no previous treatments
      have been applied against Septoria it is recommended to spray even if
      fewer than 4 days with precipitation has been counted.  Entering
      information on last fungicide spray dates is vital for the model. This is
      also done in 'Edit parameters'.  Clicking on 'Save' will keep the
      observations entered and update the risk.  After spraying, the model
      assumes that the crop is protected for 14 days if a broad spectrum
      fungicide has been applied.

      ASSUMPTIONS: Septoria tritici blotch is present in the crop and periods
      with high humidity create risk for a damaging epidemic

      click on the 'Edit parameters' button and enter information on the
      cultivar's susceptibility to brown rust. Only two categories are used
      susceptible and resistant,  if a cultivar is categorised as partly

      resistant, it is recommended to consider it as susceptible.  Enter the
      specific growth stages at the time when the crop monitoring was done. 
      Enter information on the incidence of attacked plants by brown rust based
      on scouting the crop. Between GS 30-31 whole crop should be assessed.
      Between GS 32 and 65 assessments should be based only on 3 upper leaves.
      Enter information on last fungicide spray dates is vital for the model.
      This is also  done in 'Edit parameters'.  Clicking on 'Save' will keep the
      observations  entered and update the risk.   After spraying, the model
      assumes that the crop is protected for 14 days if a broad spectrum
      fungicide has been applied.

      THE PEST: Tan spot (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis) is known to attack
      wheat   THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between
      beginning of elongation (GS 31)  and beginning of grain filling (GS 71),
      to protect leaves from attack of tan spot and yield losses.  THE MODEL:
      The CPO tan spot model is recommending treatments in wheat when thresholds
      are exceeded.  The risk of attack is based on visual monitoring using
      frequency of plants attacked. The disease observation is the percentage of
      plants showing any infection.  For example, if 25 plants out of 100 show
      even a very small amount of disease and the remaining 80 plants are
      completely healthy, then the observation is 25%.  In susceptible cultivars
      treatments are recommended at lower incidence levels than in resistant
      cultivars.  If a green color appears then no action is needed, yellow
      means that a limited risk is recognized, while red indicates that action
      is recommended.  If treatments are recommended specific fungicides known
      to be effective against this tan spot should be chosen.  When running the
      tan spot model the risk for yield losses from other diseases is not
      considered.   If no action is recommended it is advised to revisit the
      crop after approximately one week to make a new evaluation of the risk. 

      THE PARAMETERS  To obtain accurate risk predictions it is essential to
      click on the 'Edit parameters' button and enter information on the
      cultivar's susceptibility to tan spot. Only two categories are used
      susceptible and resistant, if a cultivar is categorised as partly
      resistant, it is recommended to consider it as susceptible.  Enter the
      specific growth stages at the time when the crop monitoring was done. 
      Enter information on the incidence of attacked plants by tan spot based on
      scouting the crop. Between GS  29-31 whole crop should be assessed. 
      Between GS 32 and 71 assessments should be based only on 3 upper leaves. 
      Enter information on last fungicide spray dates is vital for the model.
      This is also  done in 'Edit parameters'.  Clicking on 'Save' will keep the
      observations entered and update the risk.   After spraying, the model
      assumes that the crop is protected for 14 days if a broad spectrum
