      THE PEST: Leaf blotch diseases of wheat can be caused by septoria tritici
      blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici) and staganospora nodorum blotch
      (Parastagonospora nodorum), which are both  favoured by wet conditions. 

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between stem
      extension and ear emergence, mainly to protect the upper leaves.  

      THE MODEL: Weather data from GS 31 are used. The humidity model estimates
      risk of septoria tritici blotch infections in winter wheat. Risk of attack
      is assumed after 20 hours with continuous wetness. A wet hour is defined
      as minimum 0,2 mm precipitation in an hour or minimum 85% relative
      humidity. 

      THE PARAMETERS:  Dates of key growth stages are given as default values,
      but these may not be correct for your location.  To obtain accurate risk
      predictions it is essential to click on the 'Edit parameters' button,
      enter the estimated dates of GS31 (first node detectable), GS32 (second
      node; third upper leaf emerging), GS33 (third node; second upper leaf
      emerging), GS37/39 (uppermost flag leaf emerging)  and GS75 (grain content
      milky), then click on the 'Save' button.  These estimated dates can be
      updated during the season as growth stages are reached. Adding information
      on septoria fungicide spray dates is vital for the model. This is also
      done in 'Edit parameters'.  Clicking on 'Save' will keep the spray dates
      entered.  After spraying, the model assumes that the crop is protected for
      10 days.

      The system has been developed by Aarhus University and SEGES and covers
      main diseases and pest in cereal crops.

      The models have been developed for guidance related to leaf and stem
      diseases in cereals including

      winter Wheat, spring barley, winter barley, spring oat, winter triticale
      and winter rye.

      The system also includes models for pest control in cereals.

      The models require information from field registration typically in the
      period from GS 30-31 to GS 65-71

      (assessments of frequency of plants attacked) and for some diseases also
      precipitation is required

      (days with more than 1 mm rain). Before getting information on need for
      treatments - information on crop,

      cultivars susceptibility and growth stage (BBCH) is required.


      The growers need to check the crops at weekly intervals or as a minimum
      follow the risk based on precipitation

      or regional monitoring data for risk evaluation. In the Danish system
      fungicides and dose rates are

      recommended. In the IPM-decision system only a recommendation to treat or
      not to treat is given.


      The models have been validated in Denmark and has also been tested in the
      Baltic and Nordic

      countries. It is expected to be valid in the northern part of Europe,
      given that the monitoring part of

      the system is followed.
