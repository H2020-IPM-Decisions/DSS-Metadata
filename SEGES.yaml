    purpose: Estimates risk of septoria
    description: >
      THE PEST: Leaf blotch diseases of wheat can be caused by septoria tritici
      blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici) and staganospora nodorum blotch
      (Parastagonospora nodorum), which are both  favoured by wet conditions. 

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may need to be applied between stem
      extension and ear emergence, mainly to protect the upper leaves.  

      THE MODEL: Weather data from GS 31 are used. The humidity model estimates
      risk of septoria tritici blotch infections in winter wheat. Risk of attack
      is assumed after 20 hours with continuous wetness. A wet hour is defined
      as minimum 0,2 mm precipitation in an hour or minimum 85% relative
      humidity. 

      THE PARAMETERS:  Dates of key growth stages are given as default values,
      but these may not be correct for your location.  To obtain accurate risk
      predictions it is essential to click on the 'Edit parameters' button,
      enter the estimated dates of GS31 (first node detectable), GS32 (second
      node; third upper leaf emerging), GS33 (third node; second upper leaf
      emerging), GS37/39 (uppermost flag leaf emerging)  and GS75 (grain content
      milky), then click on the 'Save' button.  These estimated dates can be
      updated during the season as growth stages are reached. Adding information
      on septoria fungicide spray dates is vital for the model. This is also
      done in 'Edit parameters'.  Clicking on 'Save' will keep the spray dates
      entered.  After spraying, the model assumes that the crop is protected for
      10 days.

      2017. Tested in Lithuania, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark in 2018 and
      2019. 

      ASSUMPTIONS: septoria tritici blotch is present in the crop and periods
      with high humidity create risk for a damaging epidemic
