    purpose: Estimates risk of flight and egg laying in crop
    description: >
      THE PEST: The first generation of adult carrot fly emerge from pupae in
      the soil in the spring, and lay eggs close to the base of vulnerable
      crops. Larvae initial feed at the surface, then tunnel into the tap root.
      Adults emerge mid-July and can lead to a second generation. 

      THE DECISION: Treatments may need to be applied soon after adults arrive
      in the crop, before larvae tunnel into the crop roots.  

      THE MODEL: The model determines the start of the flight period for the 1st
      generation of carrot rust fly based on accumuleted degree-days (260
      day-degrees) over a base temperature of 5°C.  

      THE PARAMETERS: The model uses daily air temperature 

      SOURCE: Luke, Finland. 

      ASSUMPTIONS: Be aware that in areas with field covers (plastic, single or
      double non-woven covers, etc.) with early crops the preceding season
      (either on the current field or neighboring fields), the flight period can
      start earlier than predicted due to higher soil temperature under the
      covers.

    description: >
      THE PEST: Cabbage root fly larvae feed on the roots of brassicas, with
      damage being dependant on the crop type, growth stage and growing
      conditions. The cabbage root fly adults begin to lay eggs 5-7 days after
      emergence.  Newly transplanted or recently emerged crops are most at risk
      as the root systems are less developed. 

      THE DECISION: Treatments may need to be applied soon after adults arrive
      in the crop, before subsequent larvae tunnel into the crop roots.  

      THE MODEL: The model determins the start of egg laying as 160 degree-days
      (day-degrees) based on soil temperature (10 cm), over a base of
      temperature of 4 °C), OR based on the standard air temperature (2 m above
      the soil surface) at the same locations, egg laying starts at 210 degree
      days. 

      THE PARAMETERS: The model uses Daily soil OR air temperature 

      SOURCE: NIBIO, Norway. 

      ASSUMPTIONS: Be aware that in areas with field covers (plastic, single or
      double non-woven covers, etc.) with early crops the preceding season
      (either on the current field or neighboring fields), the flight period can
      start earlier due to higher soil temperature under the covers. This model
      should be used in combination with direct observations of eggs in the
      field. This is due to large variability and to get an idea of the severity
      of attack. The model only applies for cabbage fly, not turnip fly.

      The model for the warning system for cabbage moth was developed by Dr.
      Nina Svae Johansen. 

      It is based on the minimum temperature threshold and the requirement for
      accumulated 

      day-degrees for the different stages of the cabbage moth [CITATION Joh96
      \t \l 1044 ]. 

      The accumulated degree-day model calculates forecasts for development of
      the cabbage moth 

      through the summer, generates warnings for the time when eggs and small
      larvae can be 

      registered in the field and the best time for treatment [CITATION Joh97 \t
      \l 1044 ].


      Note that the model is based on temperature, it is not related to the
      presence or 

      absence of cabbage moth in the field. Thus, it is important to evaluate
      the situation in the field.

    purpose: 'Estimates risk of damage by Carrot Rust Fly'
    description: >-
      The warning system model is based on weekly observations of adult carrot
      rust flies captured on yellow sticky traps. The model is based in its
      entirety on observations, with no input of weather data or weather
      forecasts. Traps are placed in the field edge and in the field and are
      examined for carrot rust flies weekly throughout the season. The number of
      adult carrot rust flies is registered in VIPS and is used in the warning
      system model. The observations are compared with the economic threshold
      levels and a warning is calculated. After organophosphates (which had a
      good effect against larvae) were removed from the market, they were
      replaced by pyrethroids that only work against the adult stage. Studies
      were carried out in 2005 and 2006 to adjust the larval-based thresholds to
      chemical control of adult flies. The experience from Norway and other
      countries indicated that the first treatment against carrot rust flies
      should be done as soon as possible after the first fly is observed on the
      traps. The threshold that is used in VIPS is therefore at the first
      observation of 1 fly.

    description: >-
      The warning system model is based on weekly observations of oviposition by
      the 

      brassica root flies [CITATION Bli991 \l 1044 ]. The model is based in its
      entirety 

      on observations, with no input of weather data or weather forecasts. The
      model does 

      not distinguish between the cabbage maggot and the turnip fly. The
      observations consist 

      of collecting sand from the base of 10 plants and floating the eggs in
      water. The 

      counts are registered in VIPS and the mean number of eggs is calculated.
      The observations 

      are compared to damage thresholds [CITATION Bli99 \l 1044 ] and warnings
      are calculated.

      The damage thresholds are related to the plants developmental stage and
      tell how many eggs 

      that can be on a plant before there will be a reduction in growth and
      yield. VIPS presents 

      two warning system models based on damage thresholds: one for newly
      planted cabbage and 

      one for cabbage that has been in the field more than 4 weeks. The model
      can also be set up 

      as a private warning for the farmer’s own field, in which case the model
      will vary between 

      the two different damage thresholds based on the age of the cabbage crop
      (starting at the 

      time of planting).

      The warning system model is only valid for cabbage, cauliflower and
      broccoli. The damage 

      threshold for cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli the first 4 weeks after
      planting is 14 eggs 

      per plant per week. After 4 weeks the damage threshold changes to 40 eggs
      per plant per 

      week. Damage thresholds have not been determined for other crucifers.

      THE PEST: Potato late blight is caused by Phytophthora infestans, a
      fungus-like microorganism that causes the most devastating disease of
      potato. It spreads rapidly in the canopy, and can also infect tubers

      THE DECISION: Protective fungicide treatments are needed to protect the
      crop when conditions for infection are favorable

      THE MODEL: The model predicts if there are favorable conditions for spore
      production and the following conditions for spread, survival and infection
      of these spores. The model produces an infection risk, where a value of
      2.5 is the threshold where a warning is issued.

      THE PARAMETERS: The model uses temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind,
      radiation, leaf wetness and vapor pressure deficit as input parameters

      SOURCE: Developed by NIBIO in Norway 

      ASSUMPTIONS: Spores of potato late blight are present

            A control measure should be considered based on cultivar resistance,
            time of last application and choice of fungicide. Risk of infection
            is highest after several consecutive days with warnings, and

      THE PEST: Alternaria sp cause disease on a lot of horticultural crops, and
      leaf spots are among the most common symptoms. 

      THE DECISION: Fungicide treatments may be needed to protect the crop when
      symptoms have been observed, and conditions are favourable for pathogen
      spread and infection

      THE MODEL: TOMCAST is a weather-based model, derived from a model
      originally developed for leaf spot diseases in tomato. The model
      calculates daily risk values (DSV: Disease Severity Values) based on
      temperature and leaf wetness the previous day. DSV represents the risk of
      attack of early blight the previous 24 hours. Daily values of DSV are
      accumulated until a threshold value (adjustable) is reached, and treatment
      is recommended. When a spray is performed and entered into the model,
      accumulation of DSV is reset and starts over at 0.

      THE PARAMETERS: The model uses temperature and leaf wetness as input
      parameters

      SOURCE: Based on the dew sub model of FAST (Madden et al., 1978),
      originally targeted at predicting early blight, Septoria leaf spot and
      anthracnose on tomatoes (Gleason et al., 1995). Tested and adapted to be
      used against early blight (Alternaria solani) in potato in Denmark (Abuley
      and Nielsen, 2017).

    description: >-
      THE PEST: Potato late blight, caused by the fungus-like organism
      Phytophthora infestans causes severe damage to the foliage and can infect
      the tubers at harvest. THE DECISION: The model is designed to guide the
      timing of the first late blight fungicide application, when used in
      combination with other agronomic risk factors.  THE MODEL: The model uses
      weather data to estimate the 'epidemic free' period ('negative prognosis')
      by calculating the accumulated blight risk from the date of crop
      emergence. The model guides the first spray timing at the end of the
      'epidemic free' period.  THE PARAMETERS: From the date of crop emergence,
      daily risk values are accumulated based on weather data (temperature,
      relative humidity and precipitation). The risk is an accumulated value of
      how the weather affects late blight germination/infection, sporulation and
      growth. All processes are corrected for inhibition due to drying. After
      the accumulated risk has reached certain thresholds, there is likely to be
      moderate or high blight risk.  SOURCE: The model was first introduced by
      Schrodter and Ullrich in Germany in the 1970s and has been widely used in
      Europe since.   ASSUMPTIONS: The model is based on weather data.  Other
      agronomic factors, such as time of row closure, cultivar susceptibility,
      the presence or absence of blight inoculum sources, are not included in
      the risk estimate. It is not applicable to potatoes grown under
      protection.   REFERENCE: After the original paper by Ullrich, J. &
      Schrödter, H. (1966), the negative prognosis model was tested in other
      countries (e.g. by Taylor M. C. 2003 in the UK) and was commonly combined
      with other models to guide subsequent fungicide applications.  Combined
      models, such as NegFry, have been tested in many countries, e.g. by Hansen
      J. G. et al., 1995 in Denmark;

    description: >+
      THE PEST: Septoria apiicola is the cause of late blight of celery and
      celeriac.  Leaf spots with characteristic small dark pycnidia form on
      leaves and stems. 


      THE DECISION: If inoculum is present, symptoms can be expected to appear
      7-14 days after predicted infection risk. It is recommended to intensify
      field inspections after periods of risk alerts.


      THE MODEL: This model is based on a calculation of how leaf wetness
      periods influence infection of celery by Septoria apiicola in susceptible
      host plants.


      THE PARAMETERS: Forecasts of infection risk are given after a minimum of
      12 consecutive hours of leaf wetness. 

      SOURCE: The model is developed in Michigan, USA and published by Lacy,
      1994.

      SOURCE: 

      ASSUMPTIONS: In Norway, the model is recommended used as a guidance for
      field inspections for early detection of symptoms. It is generally assumed
      that this model has additional relevance for Septoria petroselini in
      parsley.

    purpose: 'Weather based infection risk alerts '
    description: >-
      THE PEST: Lettuce downy mildew (Bremia lactucae) is a disease caused by a
      fungus-like organism (oomycete). Symptoms are light green to yellow
      angular lesions, with a white mass of spores favoured by wet conditions. 

      THE DECISION: In the event of a risk alert, the potential need for
      fungicide sprays should be assessed based on the relevant lettuce
      varieties' resistance to downy mildew and the time interval from previous
      treatments. 


      The MODEL: The model indicates risk of Bremia lactucae infections in
      lettuce crops based on climatic conditions. Criteria for both sporulation
      and infection need to fulfilled before a risk period is calculated.
      Sporulation requires high relative humidity at night. Infection will
      require free moisture in the following day.  

      THE PARAMETERS: leaf wetness, relative humidity, global radiation, maximum
      temperature,

      SOURCE: The model is based on studies from California, US (Scherm et al
      1995, Scherm and van Bruggen, 1995, Wu et al 2002), with adaptations to
      fit Norwegian conditions
