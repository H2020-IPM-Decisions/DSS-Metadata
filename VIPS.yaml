    purpose: Estimates risk of flight and egg laying in crop
    description: >
      THE PEST: The first generation of adult carrot fly emerge from pupae in
      the soil in the spring, and lay eggs close to the base of vulnerable
      crops. Larvae initial feed at the surface, then tunnel into the tap root.
      Adults emerge mid-July and can lead to a second generation. 

      THE DECISION: Treatments may need to be applied soon after adults arrive
      in the crop, before larvae tunnel into the crop roots.  

      THE MODEL: The model determines the start of the flight period for the 1st
      generation of carrot rust fly based on accumuleted degree-days (260
      day-degrees) over a base temperature of 5°C.  

      THE PARAMETERS: The model uses daily air temperature 

      SOURCE: Luke, Finland. 

      ASSUMPTIONS: Be aware that in areas with field covers (plastic, single or
      double non-woven covers, etc.) with early crops the preceding season
      (either on the current field or neighboring fields), the flight period can
      start earlier than predicted due to higher soil temperature under the
      covers.

    purpose: Estimates risk of flight and egg laying in crop
    description: >
      THE PEST: Cabbage root fly larvae feed on the roots of brassicas, with
      damage being dependant on the crop type, growth stage and growing
      conditions. The cabbage root fly adults begin to lay eggs 5-7 days after
      emergence.  Newly transplanted or recently emerged crops are most at risk
      as the root systems are less developed. 

      THE DECISION: Treatments may need to be applied soon after adults arrive
      in the crop, before subsequent larvae tunnel into the crop roots.  

      THE MODEL: The model determins the start of egg laying as 160 degree-days
      (day-degrees) based on soil temperature (10 cm), over a base of
      temperature of 4 °C), OR based on the standard air temperature (2 m above
      the soil surface) at the same locations, egg laying starts at 210 degree
      days. 

      THE PARAMETERS: The model uses Daily soil OR air temperature 

      SOURCE: NIBIO, Norway. 

      ASSUMPTIONS: Be aware that in areas with field covers (plastic, single or
      double non-woven covers, etc.) with early crops the preceding season
      (either on the current field or neighboring fields), the flight period can
      start earlier due to higher soil temperature under the covers. This model
      should be used in combination with direct observations of eggs in the
      field. This is due to large variability and to get an idea of the severity
      of attack. The model only applies for cabbage fly, not turnip fly.

      The model for the warning system for cabbage moth was developed by Dr.
      Nina Svae Johansen. 

      It is based on the minimum temperature threshold and the requirement for
      accumulated 

      day-degrees for the different stages of the cabbage moth [CITATION Joh96
      \t \l 1044 ]. 

      The accumulated degree-day model calculates forecasts for development of
      the cabbage moth 

      through the summer, generates warnings for the time when eggs and small
      larvae can be 

      registered in the field and the best time for treatment [CITATION Joh97 \t
      \l 1044 ].


      Note that the model is based on temperature, it is not related to the
      presence or 

      absence of cabbage moth in the field. Thus, it is important to evaluate
      the situation in the field.

      The warning system model is based on weekly observations of adult carrot
      rust flies captured on yellow sticky traps. The model is based in its
      entirety on observations, with no input of weather data or weather
      forecasts. Traps are placed in the field edge and in the field and are
      examined for carrot rust flies weekly throughout the season. The number of
      adult carrot rust flies is registered in VIPS and is used in the warning
      system model. The observations are compared with the economic threshold
      levels and a warning is calculated. After organophosphates (which had a
      good effect against larvae) were removed from the market, they were
      replaced by pyrethroids that only work against the adult stage. Studies
      were carried out in 2005 and 2006 to adjust the larval-based thresholds to
      chemical control of adult flies. The experience from Norway and other
      countries indicated that the first treatment against carrot rust flies
      should be done as soon as possible after the first fly is observed on the
      traps. The threshold that is used in VIPS is therefore at the first
      observation of 1 fly.

      The warning system model is based on weekly observations of oviposition by
      the 

      brassica root flies [CITATION Bli991 \l 1044 ]. The model is based in its
      entirety 

      on observations, with no input of weather data or weather forecasts. The
      model does 

      not distinguish between the cabbage maggot and the turnip fly. The
      observations consist 

      of collecting sand from the base of 10 plants and floating the eggs in
      water. The 

      counts are registered in VIPS and the mean number of eggs is calculated.
      The observations 

      are compared to damage thresholds [CITATION Bli99 \l 1044 ] and warnings
      are calculated.

      The damage thresholds are related to the plants developmental stage and
      tell how many eggs 

      that can be on a plant before there will be a reduction in growth and
      yield. VIPS presents 

      two warning system models based on damage thresholds: one for newly
      planted cabbage and 

      one for cabbage that has been in the field more than 4 weeks. The model
      can also be set up 

      as a private warning for the farmer’s own field, in which case the model
      will vary between 

      the two different damage thresholds based on the age of the cabbage crop
      (starting at the 

      time of planting).

      The warning system model is only valid for cabbage, cauliflower and
      broccoli. The damage 

      threshold for cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli the first 4 weeks after
      planting is 14 eggs 

      per plant per week. After 4 weeks the damage threshold changes to 40 eggs
      per plant per 

      week. Damage thresholds have not been determined for other crucifers.

      The model is based on several years of experiments where trap plants have
      been placed next to a potato field infected with late blight. Infections
      on these plants have been correlated with weather conditions the day of
      exposure, and this is the data the model is based on. The model predicts
      if there are favourable conditions for spore production and the following
      spread, survival and infection of these spores. The model produces an
      infection risk, and a value of 2.5 corresponds to one spot of late blight
      on each trap plant exposed. This value of 2.5 is the threshold where the
      model issues a warning.

      diseases in tomato. The model that is used here is tested and adapted to
      be used against early blight in potato in Denmark (Alternaria solani). The
      model calculates daily risk values (DSV: Disease Severity Values) based on
      temperature and leaf wetness the previous day. DSV represents the risk of
      attack of early blight the previous 24 hours. Daily values of DSV are
      accumulated until a threshold value is reached, and treatment is
      recommended. When a spray is performed and entered into the model,
      accumulation of DSV is reset and starts over at 0.

      THE PEST: Potato late blight, caused by the fungus-like organism
      Phytophthora infestans causes severe damage to the foliage and can infect
      the tubers at harvest. THE DECISION: The model is designed to guide the
      timing of the first late blight fungicide application, when used in
      combination with other agronomic risk factors.  THE MODEL: The model uses
      weather data to estimate the ‘epidemic free’ period (‘negative prognosis’)
      by calculating the accumulated blight risk from the date of crop
      emergence. The model guides the first spray timing at the end of the
      ‘epidemic free’ period.  THE PARAMETERS: From the date of crop emergence,
      daily risk values are accumulated based on weather data (temperature,
      relative humidity and precipitation). The risk is an accumulated value of
      how the weather affects late blight germination/infection, sporulation and
      growth. All processes are corrected for inhibition due to drying. After
      the accumulated risk has reached certain thresholds, there is likely to be
      moderate or high blight risk.  SOURCE: The model was first introduced by
      Schrodter and Ullrich in Germany in the 1970s and has been widely used in
      Europe since.   ASSUMPTIONS: The model is based on weather data.  Other
      agronomic factors, such as time of row closure, cultivar susceptibility,
      the presence or absence of blight inoculum sources, are not included in
      the risk estimate. It is not applicable to potatoes grown under
      protection.   REFERENCE: After the original paper by Ullrich, J. &
      Schrödter, H. (1966), the negative prognosis model was tested in other
      countries (e.g. by Taylor M. C. 2003 in the UK) and was commonly combined
      with other models to guide subsequent fungicide applications.  Combined
      models, such as NegFry, have been tested in many countries, e.g. by Hansen
      J. G. et al., 1995 in Denmark;

      This model is based on a calculation of how leaf wetness periods influence
      infection of celery by Septoria apiicola in susceptible host plants.


      Forecasts of infection risk are given after a minimum of 12 consecutive
      hours of leaf wetness. The wet periods are calculated from sensors placed
      30 cm above ground. If such a sensor is not available, data from leaf
      wetness sensors placed 2 m above ground are used.


      The model is developed in Michigan, USA and published by Lacy, 1994.


      It is generally assumed that this model has additional relevance for
      Septoria petroselini in parsley.
