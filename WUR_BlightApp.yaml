    purpose: >-
      THE PEST: Late bllight is a fungal disease that can cause severe damage to
      crop foliage and can also infect the tubers. 

      THE DECISION: Fungicides are used to control late blight. Spraying time
      and fungicide choice are the most important factor for successful potato
      late blight control. The Garmmaps BlightApp support potato growers in
      implementing an optimized preventive potato late blight control strategy
      throughout the season. In addition to preventive spray applications, an
      alert is issued when curative- and even eradicant stop sprays are
      required. 

      THE MODEL: Spray advice is based on analysis of continously updated, 500 x
      500  m high resolution weather data, on field level. Forecasted weather
      data is used to identify potentioal in fection events in the near future.
      Measured weather data is used to check for gaps in the crop's protection
      under the actual spray schedule. The BlightApp will recommend a preventive
      spray application shortly before predicted infection events. A curative
      spray application is recommended when infection just may have occurred.
      Eradicant spray applications are recommended when infection may have
      occurred in the recent past. BlightAPp also takes into account the
      sometimes rapid growth of a crop. Fast growth in combination with high
      disease pressure may require a shorter spray interval. The level of
      disease pressure can be increased or lowered according to the local
      situation. Fungicide characteristics are imported from the Euroblight
      fungicide table and include protectant as well as curative abilities,
      protection of new growth, tuber protection and rain fastness.

      THE PARAMETERS: The DSS uses high resolution weather data, crop growth
      rate and local disease pressure. Crop growth and local disease pressure
      can be adjusted by the user.

      SOURCE: The DSS is developed by Wageningen Research and is tested in
      several countries and can be used accross Europe. Before using BlightApp
      the user needs to create an (free) account on Farmmaps, create a farm and
      buy the application. The costs of using BlightApp are 250€/year.
