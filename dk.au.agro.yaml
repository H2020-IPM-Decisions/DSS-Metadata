      Early-warning system to improve preparedness and resilience to emerging
      rust diseases on wheat
    description: >
      RustWatch is an established stakeholder driven early-warning system to improve preparedness 
      and resilience to emerging rust diseases on wheat. Rust diseases are very dynamic, which makes 
      it very important to follow changes in aggressiveness and spreading pattern, e.g. the existing 
      population of wheat yellow rust has been replaced by invasive races of non-European origin (2011) 
      and since 2016 Europe has experienced more severe epidemics of wheat stem rust. If you want more 
      detailed information about the collected rust data, take a look at the GRRC platform. 
      https://gis-au.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/6817a33478df49d39176863fdc67fe15

      RustWatch partners keep an eye on the development of rust species and races in order to evaluate 
      their potential impact on agricultural productivity. and finally develop research and communication 
      infrastructures including stakeholder networks.. The research and phenotyping is essential for the 
      plant breeders screening for new resistant cultivars.

      RustWatch engages 12 universities/research institutes, 5 agricultural advisory services, and 7 
      SMEs/industries. After the project ended in 2022, RustWatch is now a “RustWatch - a wheat rust 
      network for Europe”. Pan-European surveillance, race phenotyping and other research activities will 
      continue based on coordination of related projects, national activities and agreed business models. 
      Everybody interested in early warning and wheat rust diseases are welcome to join this network and 
      participate in RustWatch activities.
