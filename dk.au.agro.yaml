      Early-warning system to improve preparedness and resilience to emerging
      rust diseases on wheat
    description: >


      RustWatch will establish a stakeholder driven early-warning system to
      improve preparedness and resilience to emerging rust diseases on wheat,
      which is Europe’s largest agricultural crop. This is urgent because Europe
      in 2016 experienced the most severe epidemics of wheat stem rust for more
      than 50 years, and the pre-existing population of wheat yellow rust has
      been replaced by invasive races of non-European origin.


      RustWatch will explore the drivers shaping the new European wheat rust
      populations, assess their impact on agricultural productivity in the
      context of IPM Directive 2009/128/EC, and finally develop research and
      communication infrastructures including stakeholder networks and existing
      global networks.


      RustWatch provides beyond state-of-theart research within new diagnostic
      tools, enabling rapid and precise identification of new invasive races,
      and investigating the impact of virulence, aggressiveness and adaptation
      to warmer temperatures as drivers of pathogen spread and establishment.
      The research has potential for a break-through in the area of host
      resistance phenotyping, e.g., by going beyond the observation of disease
      and categorize resistance responses at the cellular level. This
      phenotyping is essential for utilizing the vast amount of genomic sequence
      information produced by new emerging breeding technologies.


      The early warning system for prevention and control of rust diseases will
      become implemented via case studies in five regions. The case studies will
      aid in development and validation of the systems in collaboration with a
      wide array of stakeholder groups, involve agricultural advisers in disease
      surveillance and sampling for later diagnosis, and collect information
      about potential barriers in adopting the system.


      RustWatch engages 12 universities/research institutes, 5 agricultural
      advisory services, and 7 SMEs/industries.
