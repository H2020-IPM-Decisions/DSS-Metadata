      The eDWIN "Virtual farm" allows users in Poland to obtain, collect and
      share information about the occurrence of pests in a given area and
      provides notifications about possible threats in the field.

      The eDWIN platform, also provides access to data from about 600
      meteorological stations throughout Poland, monitoring (among others)
      temperature, air humidity, rainfall total and intensity, atmospheric
      pressure and wind speed and direction.

      The eDWIN advisory platform was created as part of the project "Internet
      Platform for Advisory and Decision Support in Integrated Plant
      Protection". 

      The platform is completely free and available to everyone on computers and
      as an application on mobile devices, but only currently accessible to
      users in Poland.
