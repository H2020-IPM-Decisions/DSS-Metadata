AHDB.OSR_disease_forecasts.1_0.name=AHDB OSR disease forecasts
AHDB.OSR_disease_forecasts.1_0.models.LEPTMA.description=Temperature and rainfall information is used to simulate the development of Leptosphaeria maculans -- a key pathogen responsible for phoma leaf spot and phoma stem canker.\nThe forecast predicts the date of the starting week when 10% of oilseed rape plants could potentially show symptoms of phoma leaf spot.
AHDB.OSR_disease_forecasts.1_0.models.LEPTMA.name=Phoma leaf spot forecast
AHDB.OSR_disease_forecasts.1_0.models.LEPTMA.purpose=Predicts the date when 10% of oilseed rape plants may show symptoms of phoma leaf spot
AHDB.OSR_disease_forecasts.1_0.models.SCLESC.description=Sclerotinia stem rot is usually the main disease to consider during the flowering stages of oilseed rape. There are 3 main risk factors: the presence of sclerotinia inoculum (spores), warm and humid conditions, and crops in flower.\nIf spores are present and the crop is in flower, relative humidity must be above 80% and air temperatures above 7&deg;C for 23 continuous hours for the pathogen to infect the crop. This is what is predicted by the model.
AHDB.OSR_disease_forecasts.1_0.models.SCLESC.name=Sclerotinia forecast
AHDB.OSR_disease_forecasts.1_0.models.SCLESC.purpose=Predicts conditions in which infection by sclerotinia is possible
