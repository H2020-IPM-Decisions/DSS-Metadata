The model that is used here is tested and adapted to be used against early blight in potato in Denmark (Alternaria solani). The model calculates daily risk values (DSV: Disease Severity Values) based on temperature and leaf wetness the previous day. DSV represents the risk of attack of early blight the previous 24 hours. Daily values of DSV are accumulated until a threshold value is reached, and treatment is recommended. When a spray is performed and entered into the model, accumulation of DSV is reset and starts over at 0.\n

The number of adult carrot rust flies is registered in VIPS and is used in the warning system model. The observations are compared with the economic threshold levels and a warning is calculated. After organophosphates (which had a good effect against larvae) were removed from the market, they were replaced by pyrethroids that only work against the adult stage. Studies were carried out in 2005 and 2006 to adjust the larval-based thresholds to chemical control of adult flies. The experience from Norway and other countries indicated that the first treatment against carrot rust flies should be done as soon as possible after the first fly is observed on the traps. The threshold that is used in VIPS is therefore at the first observation of 1 fly.\n

The model determines the start of the flight period for the 1st and 2nd generation of carrot rust fly based on accumuleted degree-days (day-degrees) over a base temperature of 5,0 \u00C2\u00B0C. VIPS uses the model for the 1st generation only. \nStandard air temperature (temperature measured 2 m above ground) is used in the model. Degree-days are defined for this model as the sum of the difference between a base temperature of 5,0 \u00C2\u00B0C and the mean temperature for all days with a temperature >5,0 \u00C2\u00B0C, in other words (daily mean temperature \u00E2\u0080\u0093 5,0 \u00C2\u00B0C) from 1 March (beginning when the ground has thawed).\n

The wet periods are calculated from sensors placed 30 cm above ground. If such a sensor is not available, data from leaf wetness sensors placed 2 m above ground are used.\n\nThe model is developed in Michigan, USA and published by Lacy, 1994.\n\nIt is generally assumed that this model has additional relevance for Septoria petroselini in parsley.\n
