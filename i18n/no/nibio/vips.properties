no.nibio.vips.2_0.models.DELIARADIC.description=THE PEST: Cabbage root fly larvae feed on the roots of brassicas, with damage being dependant on the crop type, growth stage and growing conditions. The cabbage root fly adults begin to lay eggs 5-7 days after emergence.  Newly transplanted or recently emerged crops are most at risk as the root systems are less developed. \nTHE DECISION: Treatments may need to be applied soon after adults arrive in the crop, before subsequent larvae tunnel into the crop roots.  \nTHE MODEL: The model determins the start of egg laying as 160 degree-days (day-degrees) based on soil temperature (10 cm), over a base of temperature of 4 °C), OR based on the standard air temperature (2 m above the soil surface) at the same locations, egg laying starts at 210 degree days. \nTHE PARAMETERS: The model uses Daily soil OR air temperature \nSOURCE: NIBIO, Norway. \nASSUMPTIONS: Be aware that in areas with field covers (plastic, single or double non-woven covers, etc.) with early crops the preceding season (either on the current field or neighboring fields), the flight period can start earlier due to higher soil temperature under the covers. This model should be used in combination with direct observations of eggs in the field. This is due to large variability and to get an idea of the severity of attack. The model only applies for cabbage fly, not turnip fly.\n

no.nibio.vips.2_0.models.NEGPROGMOD.description=THE PEST: Potato late blight, caused by the fungus-like organism Phytophthora infestans causes severe damage to the foliage and can infect the tubers at harvest. THE DECISION: The model is designed to guide the timing of the first late blight fungicide application, when used in combination with other agronomic risk factors.  THE MODEL: The model uses weather data to estimate the ‘epidemic free’ period (‘negative prognosis’) by calculating the accumulated blight risk from the date of crop emergence. The model guides the first spray timing at the end of the ‘epidemic free’ period.  THE PARAMETERS: From the date of crop emergence, daily risk values are accumulated based on weather data (temperature, relative humidity and precipitation). The risk is an accumulated value of how the weather affects late blight germination/infection, sporulation and growth. All processes are corrected for inhibition due to drying. After the accumulated risk has reached certain thresholds, there is likely to be moderate or high blight risk.  SOURCE: The model was first introduced by Schrodter and Ullrich in Germany in the 1970s and has been widely used in Europe since.   ASSUMPTIONS: The model is based on weather data.  Other agronomic factors, such as time of row closure, cultivar susceptibility, the presence or absence of blight inoculum sources, are not included in the risk estimate. It is not applicable to potatoes grown under protection.   REFERENCE: After the original paper by Ullrich, J. & Schrödter, H. (1966), the negative prognosis model was tested in other countries (e.g. by Taylor M. C. 2003 in the UK) and was commonly combined with other models to guide subsequent fungicide applications.  Combined models, such as NegFry, have been tested in many countries, e.g. by Hansen J. G. et al., 1995 in Denmark;

no.nibio.vips.2_0.models.NEGPROGMOD.output.warning_status_interpretation.0.explanation=This model calculates accumulated blight risk from crop emergence. ‘Risk Status’ shows the accumulated risk reached on each day (i.e. it does not show if the weather was high or low blight risk on that particular day). ’Infection risk’ shows the increasing accumulated risk.     This risk model guides the timing of the first fungicide application. When accumulated risk is less than 120 (green), the risk of blight is low. Between 120 and 150 (orange), there is a risk of blight if other risk factors (e.g. sources of blight inoculum or cultivar susceptibility) are high. Above 150 (red), the risk is likely to be high. Above 200 the model becomes inactive as the first spray should already have been applied in most circumstances. The ‘Risk Status’ chart shows the accumulated risk reached on each day (i.e. it does not show if the weather was high or low blight risk on that particular day). The ’Infection risk’ chart shows the increasing accumulated risk.
