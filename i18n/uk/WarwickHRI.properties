uk.WarwickHRI.0_0_1.models.HYLERA.description=THE PEST: The cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) overwinters as a pupa, in diapause.  The first generation of adult flies emerges in the spring  and mated female flies lay their eggs in the soil close to the base of brassica plants.  After hatching, the larvae feed on the roots and may tunnel into them, causing damage.  These larvae form pupae, which lead to the emergence of a new generation of adults.  Depending on the local climate the number of cabbage root fly generations and their timing can differ.  When the weather is particularly hot, cabbage root fly pupae  may aestivate.  In some areas there is an additional biotype of cabbage root fly which has an extended pupal diapause and emerges later in the spring.  We call the two biotypes �early emerging� and �late emerging�.  \nTHE DECISION: The model predicts the timing of adult emergence and egg-laying throughout the year, enabling users to undertake targeted monitoring  and/or mitigating actions to reduce the risk of damage to the crop.\nTHE MODEL: A series of development rate equations form the basis of the simulation model and are linked together in a program.   The model simulates the development of cohorts of 500 individuals through adult emergence, egg laying and hatching. For each stage, the percentage development is calculated each day by integrating the appropriate development rate curve. This percentage is accumulated over days until it reaches  100. At this point the individual moves to the next stage. Variability within the insect population is incorporated by assuming that, at any instant,  the rates of development of a population held at a constant temperature are normally distributed (Phelps et al, 1993).  The model uses soil temperatures  or air temperatures depending on the stage of development. Within the model it is possible to specify the proportions of the early and late emerging biotypes  in the simulated population. As multiple cohorts progress simultaneously, adult emergence and egg laying can occur at the same time.\nTHE PARAMETERS: The Cabbage Root Fly forecast requires hourly soil temperatures at a depth of approximately 6 cm and hourly air temperatures.\nREGION: This DSS was adapted from work carried out in the UK\nASSUMPTION: The start date for the model is 1st February, as this is often the coldest period in the year.\nREFERENCE: Collier, R.H. & Finch, S.

Large narcissus flies overwinter inside damaged bulbs as fully-grown larvae which move into the soil to form pupae in the spring.

uk.WarwickHRI.0_0_1.models.MELIAE.description=THE PEST: Adult pollen (bronzed-blossom) beetles (Meligethes aeneus/Brassicogethes aeneus) overwinter in the soil.   The beetles become active in early spring and fly to flowering brassica crops about a month later, where they feed on  the buds and flowers.  During feeding, females chew holes in the bases of the unopened flower buds and lay eggs in each hole.   After hatching, the larvae feed initially on pollen but later feed on unopened flowers and finally on newly-formed seed pods.  The fully-grown larvae drop to the soil where they pupate.  Adult (summer) beetles emerge 2-3 weeks later and the majority disperse to feed on other plants, including the florets of cauliflower crops, before they move to overwintering sites.   There is only one generation each year.\nTHE DECISION: This model predicts the timing of spring emergence of adult beetles, egg laying and then the emergence of a new (summer)  generation of adults ready to disperse, followed by their dispersal.  This enables users to undertake targeted monitoring and/or  mitigating actions to reduce the risk of damage to the crop.\nTHE MODEL: A series of development rate equations form the basis of the simulation model and are linked together in a program.   The model simulates the development of cohorts of 500 individuals through spring emergence, egg laying and hatching, larval and pupal  development and emergence, followed by dispersal of the new generation of adult beetles. For each stage, the percentage development is  calculated each day by integrating the appropriate development rate curve. This percentage is accumulated over days until it reaches 100. At this point the individual moves to the next stage. Variability within the insect population is incorporated by assuming that, at any instant,  the rates of development of a population held at a constant temperature are normally distributed (Phelps et al, 1993).  The model uses soil  temperatures or air temperatures depending on the stage of development. As multiple cohorts progress simultaneously, adult emergence/dispersal  and egg laying can occur at the same time.\nTHE PARAMETERS: The Pollen Beetle forecast requires hourly soil temperatures at a depth of approximately 6 cm and hourly air temperatures.\nREGION: This DSS was adapted from work carried out in the UK\nASSUMPTION: The start date for the model is 1st February, as this is often the coldest period in the year.\nREFERENCE: Phelps, K., Collier, R.H., Reader, R.J. & Finch, S.

Medium risk is indicated when any of the following is reached for any of the generations; 1) up to 10% cumulative emergence,  and/or 2) up to 10% cumulative egg laying.  To determine the cause of the risk, please refer to the accompanying plots,  which illustrate when a threshold has been surpassed.
uk.WarwickHRI.0_0_1.models.PSILRO.output.warning_status_interpretation.4.explanation=This model runs February - December. Based on current data available, the model is predicting high risk. 
uk.WarwickHRI.0_0_1.models.PSILRO.output.warning_status_interpretation.4.recommended_action=The risk of 1) emergence, and/or 2) egg laying, is high.  Monitor vulnerable crops for in-field activity. High risk is indicated when any of the following is reached for any of the generations; 1) 10-50% cumulative emergence,  and/or 2) 10-50% cumulative egg laying.  To determine the cause of the risk, please refer to the accompanying plots,  which illustrate when a threshold has been surpassed.
