    description: >-
      THE PEST: Widely present in many horticultural and arable fields, slugs
      can damage crops all year round. With impacts on yield and/or quality
      potentially severe, it is important to manage populations of key slug
      species. 

      THE DECISION: Management of slug infestations is most effective when
      targeted at periods of high slug activity. The SlugWatch forecast provides
      location-specific slug activity data, along with information on weather
      conditions, helping make informed decisions on timing and location of slug
      monitoring and subsequent management. 

      THE MODEL: The SlugWatch model predicts slug activity based on forecast
      weather conditions. 

      THE PARAMETERS: The model uses soil temperature, air temperature and
      rainfall. 

      SOURCE: Created by CertisBelchim and developed by Farming Online Ltd.
      Validated in the UK and France, considered to be appropriate for use with
      caution in Ireland, Spain, Belgium the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark. 

      ASSUMPTIONS: This model makes no prediction on actual slug abundance, only
      the relative risk of slug activity if they are present. In field
      monitoring is required to assess the actual risk to crops of high slug
      activity. Please refer to appropriate economic thresholds for treatment.
